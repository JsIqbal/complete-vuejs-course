## Data Property in Vue Instance

The `data` property in a Vue instance is responsible for storing the variables for that particular instance. Because Vue.js is built on the MVVM architectural pattern, it keeps the data separate from the view, resulting in a better-organized application. This means that all the variables used in the application would be kept in a separate space dedicated to this task only.

### Data Types

The variables in Vue.js are JavaScript-style variables and support all the standard types available in vanilla JavaScript. These types include:

-   String: Stores strings.
-   Number: Stores integers, floating-point, and exponential notations.
-   Boolean: Stores 'true' or 'false'.
-   Null: Represents a null value.
-   Object: Stores a dictionary.
-   Array: Stores a list of variables.

We have seen how data variables are stored separately and how they are not directly connected to the view layer. But there must be a way to connect data variables to the template. Now, let's see how these variables are referenced from the view (i.e., template).

### Referencing Data Variables in Template

The variables in the `data` of a Vue instance are referenced using `{{}}` interpolation. For example, if a variable `name` is presented and its value must be shown in the template, place the variable in the code shown above, which is inside curly braces, i.e., `{{ name }}`. This will replace `{{ name }}` with the current value of the variable `name`.

## Methods Property in Vue Instance

The `methods` property in the Vue instance contains the definitions of all the functions that the Vue instance can perform. This is similar to vanilla JavaScript methods/functions as they can also be defined anywhere and can be called when needed or when a specific event occurs. However, in the Vue instance, its functions can only be defined in the `methods` property.

The `methods` property allows you to define functions that can be called from the Vue instance or triggered in response to specific events. These functions are used to perform actions and manipulate data within the Vue application.

Example:

Suppose we have a Vue instance:

```javascript
new Vue({
    data: {
        count: 0,
    },
    methods: {
        incrementCounter() {
            this.count++;
        },
        resetCounter() {
            this.count = 0;
        },
    },
});
```

## Vue Instance Lifecycle

When a Vue instance is created, it passes through a process comprising several steps termed as the lifecycle. This lifecycle continues until the instance is terminated. Understanding the Vue instance lifecycle is crucial to utilize its functionality effectively. Additionally, knowing the behind-the-scenes working of the Vue instance can provide valuable insights.

The Vue instance lifecycle consists of four main stages:

1. **Create**: In the create step, the instance is initialized along with events, injections, and reactivity. This is the stage where Vue sets up all the necessary data and methods, prepares event listeners, and establishes reactivity for the instance.

2. **Mount**: After the initialization, the mount stage starts. This stage replaces the target div with the template of the Vue instance. Once the Vue instance is mounted, it becomes part of the DOM, and its template is rendered on the screen.

3. **Update**: Once the Vue instance is mounted, it begins to update according to the changes in its data and methods. When there are updates to the data, Vue triggers a virtual DOM re-rendering and applies the necessary patches to the real DOM. This process is known as the update stage.

4. **Destroy**: The last stage is the destroy stage, which occurs when the instance's lifetime is completed. In this stage, Vue frees up resources, deletes variables, and cleans up the components. It is responsible for performing any necessary cleanup tasks to avoid memory leaks or unwanted side effects.

Understanding the Vue instance lifecycle helps developers to know when and where certain operations should be performed in their Vue applications. It allows for efficient management of resources and ensures that the application behaves as intended throughout its lifecycle.
